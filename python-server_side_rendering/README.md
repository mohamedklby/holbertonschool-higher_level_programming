### What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Python?

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where the server generates the HTML content of a page before sending it to the client (browser). Unlike client-side JavaScript applications, where most of the content is generated directly in the browser (using technologies like React or Vue.js), SSR generates the entire page on the server and then transmits it to the client.

This helps improve the initial page rendering speed and provides better control over search engine optimization (SEO) because the HTML content is already available when the browser loads the page.

### Advantages of SSR:

1. **Initial Performance**: The browser doesn't need to download and execute all JavaScript to display the page. The HTML content is ready to be rendered as soon as it's loaded.
   
2. **Improved SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl and index the HTML content rendered on the server, improving organic search rankings. For client-side JavaScript applications, some parts of the content may not be indexed, as they depend on JavaScript that might not be executed properly by search engine crawlers.

3. **Social Sharing**: When you share links to a page rendered with SSR, rich previews (e.g., images, titles, descriptions) are generated directly from the HTML without waiting for client-side JavaScript rendering
